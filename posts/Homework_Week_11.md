<h3>In what ways might the practice of creative coding attend to problems regarding digital infrastructure?</h3>
Practise of creating coding would help amend digital infrastructure, increasing appeal to more general audiences. Creative Coding instead focuses on code that is artistic rather than just for function.

As information becomes less secure, where we were the “product that was being sold, by the broadcaster, to advertisers. Or rather, what they sold was your attention”, Creative Coding is completely severed from this, nothing is being sold to the user, but art is being shown to the user.

In the postbroadcast era, media “not only holds our attention, it also records it.” Our information and data are being recorded and used for capital. Modern media algorithms have primed with “racist and sexist assumptions about the people it is supposed to neutrally observe.” Creative Code instead uses code for art.
