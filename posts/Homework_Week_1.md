# Homework Week 1

## Creating a Grid

I started by using the square p5js of squares moving as a base, this was because it already had way of organising squares depending on how much there were

Next, I Changed the colours of the squares and the background, changed the canvas shape, I planned to make a checkerboard pattern like a chess board

I tried messing around with making all the squares the same shape

Until I got to this which looked similar to a row in a checkerboard

I oriented the rows and repeated them to create this grid effect, Iâ€™m not to sure where the number 71 fits in on line 15, but I got it after trial and error
I also realized at this point that it was going to be much larger than the originally planned eight by eight chess board grid I was going for

I copied what I had and moved it all down, creating this stripe effect, but also assuring that the black squares were at least big enough to fill in the empty gaps!

I moved the copied effect slightly to the left to complete the checkerboard look

The squares were not completely aligned correctly so after some trial and error I got it more accurately, though it still has some small mistakes, such as the edges of some black squares overlapping.

###Reflection
In reflection, this probably was not the most effective way of making a checkerboard pattern, many numbers I had no idea of arriving at such as the 37.5, 71 and 37 on line 20, resulting in the pattern being a little faulty, and the way I just copied and moved the second set of squares is inefficient in the longer term.
